The type code `'i'` in the `array` module represents signed integers. There are several other type codes available in the `array` module, each corresponding to a different data type. Here are some commonly used type codes:

- `'b'`: Represents signed char (1 byte)
- `'B'`: Represents unsigned char (1 byte)
- `'h'`: Represents signed short (2 bytes)
- `'H'`: Represents unsigned short (2 bytes)
- `'i'`: Represents signed int (2 or 4 bytes depending on the platform)
- `'I'`: Represents unsigned int (2 or 4 bytes depending on the platform)
- `'l'`: Represents signed long (4 bytes)
- `'L'`: Represents unsigned long (4 bytes)
- `'f'`: Represents float (4 bytes)
- `'d'`: Represents double (8 bytes)

These type codes allow you to specify the data type of the elements you want to store in the array. For example, `'f'` represents floating-point numbers, and `'d'` represents double-precision floating-point numbers.

When creating an array, you pass the desired type code as the first argument to the `array` constructor. Here's an example of using different type codes:

```python
from array import array

# Create arrays with different data types
char_array = array('b', [65, 66, 67])  # 'b' for signed char
float_array = array('f', [1.23, 4.56, 7.89])  # 'f' for float

print("Char array:", char_array)
print("Float array:", float_array)
```

Output:
```
Char array: array('b', [65, 66, 67])
Float array: array('f', [1.2300000190734863, 4.559999942779541, 7.889999866485596])
```

Note that the actual size of the data types may vary based on the platform (32-bit or 64-bit). It's important to choose the appropriate data type based on your requirements and the range of values you need to store.
