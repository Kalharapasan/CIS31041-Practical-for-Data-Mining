1. Weka Explorer: Weka Explorer is the main graphical interface of Weka. 
It allows users to load datasets, preprocess data, apply various machine learning algorithms, 
visualize results, and evaluate models. 
It provides an interactive environment for exploring data, experimenting with different algorithms, 
and performing data analysis tasks.

2. Weka Experimenter: Weka Experimenter is a component that allows users to conduct large-scale experiments 
and compare the performance of multiple algorithms. It provides a streamlined workflow for running multiple datasets 
with multiple algorithms, controlling experimental conditions, and collecting comprehensive performance evaluation 
results. The Experimenter facilitates the systematic evaluation and comparison of different algorithms and 
configurations.

3. Weka Knowledge Flow: Weka Knowledge Flow provides a visual programming environment for creating data mining 
and machine learning workflows. It allows users to build complex data analysis pipelines by connecting modules 
and configuring their parameters. Knowledge Flow is particularly useful for designing and executing complex 
data preprocessing and modeling tasks, as well as automating repetitive tasks.

4. Weka Simple CLI: Weka Simple CLI is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to run Weka functionality 
from the command line or integrate it into scripts and workflows. 
It provides a way to automate tasks, perform batch processing, and incorporate Weka functionality into 
larger software systems.

5. Weka Package Manager: Weka Package Manager is a tool for managing additional extensions and packages in Weka. 
It allows users to browse, install, update, and uninstall various Weka packages, which provide additional algorithms,
filters, and visualizations beyond the core Weka functionality. 
The Package Manager makes it easy to extend Weka's capabilities with new algorithms and techniques developed 
by the Weka community.
